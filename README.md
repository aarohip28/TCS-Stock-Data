# 📈 TCS Stock Data Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes and forecasts Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) stock prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It involves end-to-end steps from data cleaning and visualization to predictive modeling with Linear Regression and LSTM.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective:** To understand stock behavior, visualize trends, and predict future TCS stock prices.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Models Used:** Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with interactive visualizations
- Moving averages and trend lines
- Feature engineering (date features, lag values)
- Linear Regression for basic prediction
- LSTM for time-series forecasting
- Evaluation with MAE and R² Score
- Comparison of actual vs predicted values using plots

## 🗂️ Dataset

Historical TCS stock data containing:
- `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`
- `Volume`, `Dividends`, `Stock Splits`

## 🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models

- **Linear Regression:** Simple baseline model using selected features like Open, High, Low, Volume, etc.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Deep learning model for sequential forecasting on closing prices.

## 📈 Visualizations

- Stock trends over time
- 30-day moving averages
- Volume and dividend trends
- Daily percentage change distributions
- Predicted vs. actual closing prices

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate additional models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Explore time-series methods like ARIMA
- Add hyperparameter tuning and model selection
- Create a front-end interface for live prediction
